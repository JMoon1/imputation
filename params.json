{"body":"##About the package##\r\n\r\n[Imputation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)) is the process of filling missing values in a dataset with a intelligently reconstructed value.  This R package provides simple methods for imputing a data matrix.  To install, open a R session and issue\r\n\r\n```\r\ninstall.packages(\"imputation\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Usage##\r\n\r\n```\r\nx = matrix(rnorm(100),10,10)\r\nx[1,1] = NA\r\nx[5,8] = NA\r\nx[2,3] = NA\r\nx[7,7] = NA\r\nk = cv.SVDImpute(x)$k\r\nSVDImpute(x, k)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Algorithms##\r\n\r\n###Mean Imputation###\r\nSimply fills missing values using the mean of the column.  The mean is the minimizer of squared error loss for i.i.d data\r\n\r\n###Persistence Imputation###\r\nFor time series data, fill an observation at time t using t-1\r\n\r\n###kNN Imputation###\r\nFind neighbors that don't have missing values, and fill using the mean of the neighbors.\r\n\r\n###SVD Imputation###\r\nLeast squares can be computed even when there is missing data.  The SVD problem can be formulated as minimizing the squared error between a matrix X and its low rank projection X*.  This problem can be solved using alternating least squares, and X* is returned as the imputed matrix.\r\n\r\n###SVT Imputation###\r\n[Singular Value Thresholding](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~candes/svt/papers.html) a la Emmanuel Candes.\r\n\r\n###GBM Imputation###\r\nUses gradient boosting machines, an ensemble of decision trees, to fill missing values.  GBM is particularly powerful because it can handle categorical data as well","tagline":"R package for data imputation","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
